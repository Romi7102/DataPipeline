## DataPipeline
treaming data pipeline using Python, Kafka, MongoDB, and Redis. The pipeline includes a producer that generates events, a consumer that processes these events and stores them in MongoDB, and an ETL process that transfers data to Redis. Containerized with Docker Compose for seamless deployment and scalability.
